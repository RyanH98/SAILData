# IJCAI 2019 AIMA4EDU Workshop Dataset Documentation 

## I. Overview

This dataset contains data from students using the Squirrel AI Learning system at 2 learning centers in China. Squirrel AI Learning (SAIL) is an AI-based adaptive learning system that delivers afterschool tutoring to K-12 students. It covers a number of academic subjects, including mathematics, English, Physics, and Chemistry.

For this dataset, while students were using SAIL, they were asked to wear a brainwave headset (BrainCo) and to have the webcam camera turned on. Thus, there are 3 main data sources for each student:

1. User records (from Squirrel AI Learning&#39;s learner records store). This contains the question level log (where each row is a question) of student responses in the learning system.
2. Brainwave data (from BrainCo). For each second of wear, this contains the raw EEG values and the derived &quot;attention&quot; values provided by BrainCo. Each row is a second of time.
3. Webcam data (containing relevant features extracted by SRI International)

The data are organized into 4 folders, each is described in more detail in the following sections.

1. [Synced](#ii-synced)
2. [User records](#iii-user-records)
3. [Brainwave](#iv-brainwave)
4. [Webcam](#v-webcam-videos)

## II. Synced

This folder contains the synced results from all three data sources. There are 2 .txt files, one for each school: (1) schooln.txt from students at School N and (2) schoolg.txt from students at school G.

There are 11 columns in each file: the first 7 columns contain information from user records, and the last 4 columns contain the associated brainwave and/or webcam data file paths. The base for synchronization is user records, where the corresponding brainwave and/or webcam data files are appended each question response, whenever there is a match.

Please note: due to difficulties during data collection and with data synchronization, not all user records have corresponding brainwave and webcam data. If the question ctime (the answer submit timestamp of the question) is within the time window of the webcam videos, we assign the corresponding video file path to that question. If the question ctime is in the time window of the brainwave files, we assign the brainwave triplets (attention, EEG, events â€“ more info in Brainwave section) to that question.

The fields/columns are:

1. _Index_: the unique row index, one per row
2. _Subjects_: subject area of study.
  1. &#39;phy&#39; = physics
  2. &#39;en&#39; = English (as a second language)
  3. &#39;en\_reading&quot; = English reading
  4. &#39;math&#39; = mathematics
  5. &#39;chem&#39; = chemistry
  6. &#39;cn&#39; = Chinese (as language arts)
3. _Question\_id_: unique question identifier in SAIL
4. _user\_id_: user identifier, unique for each student
5. _School\_id_: school identifier, unique for each school
  1. schoolg: school\_id = 196
  2. schooln: school\_id = 290
6. _Stime_: timestamp when question appears on the screen (more info in the User Records section)
7. _Ctime_: timestamp when student submits a response (more info in the User Records section)
8. _Video_\__id_: video identifier of the webcam video for the corresponding student (more info in Webcam Video section)
9. _brainwave\_file\_path\_attention_: attention log file path for the corresponding student (more info in Brainwave section)
10. _brainwave\_file\_path\_EEG_: EEG log file path for the corresponding student (more info in Brainwave section)
11. _brainwave\_file\_path\_events_: events log file path for the corresponding student (more info in Brainwave section)

## III. User Records

This folder contains 6 files, one for each of the subject area of study.

Typical flow: Each afterschool tutoring session is approximately 2 hours long. In each session, students focus on a particular set of knowledge points (tag\_code) for a specific course/subject. They typically start with a pretest or review, then view instructional videos and work on learning and practice questions, until the knowledge points have been &quot;mastered&quot;. Pretest questions do not have immediate corrective feedback, but students can view the answer and the explanations of the answer after they completed the pretest. The learning and practice questions contain hints and corrective feedback. Students can activate different levels of hints and view the answer explanation for each question, before or after submitting the response.

After each learning and practice question, SAIL computes and updates each student&#39;s proficiency level on each knowledge point to determine the next question to present. When the proficiency estimates reach a certain threshold, that knowledge point is considered &quot;learned&quot; and will be queued for review at a later time.

The user records contain student response data at the question level.

## IV. Brainwave

This folder contains the raw brainwave data from two schools: schoolg and school. Each brainwave session outputs 3 file types: attention, EEG, and events.

* attention

    1. This contains the derived attention value by BrainCo (0-100)
    2. Each row is a Unix timestamp followed by its attention value.
    3. Please convert timestamp to Beijing Time (GMT+8) if you need

* EEG

    1. This contains the raw EEG data from BrainCo
    2. Each row has the timestamp, sequence Num, battery, logging label, and EEG array.
    3. Each point represents the difference in potential between the EEG reference point and the acquisition point. There are 160 such points in a minute for uA.
    4. The vector in square brackets [] are the electrical signal output values of the sensors. These electrical signals can be transformed into frequency domain signals or waveforms (alpha, beta, gamma, etc.) by Fourier transform, and the average energy of each wave band can be calculated. BrainCo&#39;s definition: Alpha: 8-12, LowBeta: 12 -22, HighBeta: 22 -32, Gamma: 32-56
    5. Please convert timestamp to Beijing Time (GMT+8) if you need

* Events

    1. This contains the raw events data from BrainCo
    2. Each point has a Unix timestamp followed by the device stage. It indicates whether the device is connected or not in the corresponding time
    3. Please convert timestamp to Beijing Time (GMT+8) if you need

## V. Webcam Videos

In this folder contains the relevant extracted features from each video captured by the Webcam.

The extracted question segments have two files associated with each segment: a json file with metadata of the question and an npy (python numPy) file containing the tracking metadata which should be very easy to load into Python.

1. Question segments filenames name as &quot;school name\_video ids\_segment numbers.
2. Json file with metadata of the question can be retrieved from user records.
3. File named &quot;npy\_key.md&quot; describing the meanings of the various data point included in the numpy file.

Some statistics about webcam videos segments:

1. Original segments by subject: number of question segments and total video length (in seconds):

{&#39;chem&#39;: [36, 3816.0],
&#39;cn&#39;: [83, 44977.0],
&#39;en\_reading&#39;: [0, 0],
&#39;en&#39;: [680, 79960.0],
&#39;math&#39;: [896, 123495.0],
&#39;phy&#39;: [558, 83004.0]}

2. After further filtering, it contains 2170 segments:

  - Percentage of segments that have at least 50% valid tracking: 61.54%
  - Percentage of segments that have at least 70% valid tracking: 49.88%
  - Percentage of segments that have 100% valid tracking: 18.30%
